CLinkedList2.c

By Michael G. Workman

A simple C program demonstrating a Linked List using a Struct for a Zoo Animal
In this second version of this console app, we use a doubly linked list to emulate
animals in a zoo, and we create a function to search the list for certain animal types,
and also a delete operation that will delete a specific node, but keep the list intact
